Copy the driver (filedisk.sys) to %systemroot%\system32\drivers\.

The drivers in the sys\obj directory are compiled for Windows XP
(and all later versions of Windows) while the drivers in the sys\Debug
and sys\Release directories are compiled for Windows 10 and testsigned
with a SHA-2 signature.

(chk is the debug version, fre is the normal version,
i386 is for 32-bit systems and amd64 is for 64-bit systems)

Optionally edit filedisk.reg for automatic or manual start and
number of devices.

Import filedisk.reg to the Registry.

Reboot. If using an unsigned driver and running on the 64-bit version
of Windows press F8 and select "Disable enforce driver signing".
On later versions of Windows this boot setting can be reached by holding
down shift before clicking restart.

Use the program filedisk.exe to mount and umount disk or CD/DVD
images.

The drivers are testsigned, you can allow Windows to load testsigned drivers
with the command "bcdedit /set testsigning on".
